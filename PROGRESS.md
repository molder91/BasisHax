- [x] Implemented application control module for hiding applications
- [x] Developed combo mode functionality
- [x] Designed hotkey management system
- [x] Implemented settings persistence system

### Frontend Development

- [x] Connected frontend to Rust backend via Tauri commands
- [x] Added error handling and loading states

## Current Implementation Features

1. **WiFi Toggle**
   - Toggle WiFi connection on/off via UI button
   - Configurable hotkey (default: Ctrl+Shift+W)
   - Cross-platform support for macOS and Windows

2. **App Quick Hide**
   - Hide the current application via UI button
   - Configurable hotkey (default: Ctrl+Shift+H)
   - Works on both macOS and Windows

3. **Combo Mode**
   - Single-click activation to hide current app and switch context
   - Configurable hotkey (default: Ctrl+Shift+C)
   - Selectable target application

4. **Settings Management**
   - Hotkey configuration persistence
   - Combo mode configuration persistence

## Next Steps

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Test WiFi control on different macOS/Windows versions
   - Test application hiding functionality
   - Validate hotkey registration and handling
   - Resolve any permission issues

2. **Core Feature Completion**
   - Implement actual hotkey detection in the hotkey configuration modal
   - Implement system tray/menu bar integration
   - Add keyboard shortcut listening in background
   - Add startup on boot option

3. **UI Refinement**
   - Create settings screen with advanced options
   - Add dark/light mode toggle
   - Improve accessibility features

### Medium Term (2-4 Weeks)
1. **Packaging and Distribution**
   - Create installers for macOS and Windows
   - Set up auto-updates
   - Complete documentation

2. **Additional Features**
   - Add customizable application lists
   - Implement profiles for different scenarios
   - Add scheduled activation/deactivation

### Long Term (1-2 Months)
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Extend support for Linux
   - Add network monitoring capabilities
   - Implement advanced customization options

## Testing Instructions

To test the current implementation:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the SchoolHax directory
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Run the application in development mode:
   ```
   pnpm tauri dev
   ```

Note: WiFi control and application hiding may require elevated permissions depending on your operating system.

## Known Issues

1. Hotkey detection in the configuration modal is not fully implemented (manual editing only)
2. WiFi control may require specific permissions on some systems
3. Application hiding might not work with all applications, particularly those with special window management
