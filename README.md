# BasisHax

A modern utility application for Mac and Windows that helps users quickly manage their computer visibility with customizable hotkeys.

## Overview

BasisHax is designed for students and professionals who need to quickly switch contexts or maintain privacy. With customizable hotkeys, users can:

- Toggle WiFi connection on/off instantly
- Hide current applications completely (beyond just minimizing)
- Combine actions to switch contexts with a single key press

## Features

### WiFi Toggle
Instantly disable or enable your WiFi connection with a customizable hotkey.

### Application Quick Hide
Hide the current application completely - the window is closed, audio is muted, and the app won't appear in app switchers (Command+Tab/Alt+Tab).

### Combo Mode
Combine WiFi toggling with switching to a predetermined application in full screen mode.
