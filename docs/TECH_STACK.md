# Technical Stack Evaluation

This document outlines the evaluation of potential technical stacks for the BasisHax application.

## Requirements

BasisHax requires:
1. Cross-platform support (macOS and Windows)
2. System-level access for WiFi and application control
3. Global hotkey registration capabilities
4. Modern, minimalistic UI
5. Small resource footprint

## Potential Frameworks

### Option 1: Electron + React/TypeScript

**Pros:**
- Excellent cross-platform support
- Large community and resource availability
- Good system integration capabilities through Node.js
- Strong UI capabilities with React + TailwindCSS
- Familiar web technologies

**Cons:**
- Relatively large application size
- Higher memory usage
- May require additional native modules for deep OS integration

### Option 2: Tauri + React/TypeScript

**Pros:**
- Significantly smaller application size than Electron
- Lower memory footprint
- Uses Rust for backend with better performance
- Modern architecture
- Good security model

**Cons:**
- Newer framework with smaller community
- May have limitations for some system-level operations
- Requires Rust knowledge for backend development

### Option 3: Python + Qt/PyQt

**Pros:**
- Strong system integration capabilities
- Cross-platform support
- Smaller application size compared to Electron
- Powerful Qt widgets for UI

**Cons:**
- UI may feel less modern without additional work
- Deployment can be more complex
- Python packaging might add complexity

## Recommendation

Based on the above analysis, we recommend proceeding with:

**Tauri + React/TypeScript + TailwindCSS**

This combination offers:
- A modern, minimalist UI through React and TailwindCSS
- Small application size and resource usage through Tauri
- Strong system integration capabilities through Rust
- Cross-platform support for macOS and Windows

## Implementation Strategy

1. Begin by evaluating Tauri's capabilities for our specific system requirements
2. Prototype core functionality in Rust
3. Develop UI components in React with TailwindCSS
4. If any Tauri limitations are discovered, be prepared to switch to Electron as an alternative

## Next Steps

1. Set up a basic Tauri project
2. Research and prototype WiFi control on both platforms
3. Research and prototype application control on both platforms
4. Evaluate global hotkey registration capabilities
