# GitHub Push Instructions

We've successfully created the initial project structure with documentation files:

- `ROADMAP.md`: Detailed roadmap for the BasisHax project
- `README.md`: Project overview and basic information
- `LICENSE`: MIT License for the project
- `.gitignore`: Configuration for ignored files
- `docs/TECH_STACK.md`: Evaluation of technical stack options
- `docs/TECHNICAL_APPROACHES.md`: Technical implementation approaches for core features
- `docs/UI_DESIGN.md`: UI design principles and mockups

## Steps to Push to GitHub

1. **Create the Repository on GitHub**
   - Log in to GitHub
   - Create a new repository named "BasisHax"
   - Do not initialize it with README, .gitignore, or License

2. **Configure Local Git Repository**
   - The repository has been initialized with `git init`
   - Files have been added with `git add .`
   - First commit has been made with `git commit -m "Initial project setup with roadmap and documentation"`

3. **Set Up GitHub Remote**
   - Options:
     - HTTPS: `git remote add origin https://github.com/molder91/BasisHax.git`
     - SSH: `git remote add origin git@github.com:molder91/BasisHax.git`

4. **Rename Branch to Main**
   - `git branch -M main`

5. **Push to GitHub**
   - `git push -u origin main`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues pushing to GitHub:

### Repository Not Found Error
- Verify the repository exists on GitHub
- Check that the username in the URL is correct
- Ensure you have the correct permissions

### Authentication Issues
- For HTTPS: You may need to enter GitHub credentials
- For SSH: Ensure SSH keys are set up correctly
  - Check SSH key with: `ssh -T git@github.com`
  - If needed, create new SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
  - Add key to SSH agent: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
  - Add key to GitHub account through settings

### Alternative: GitHub CLI
If you have GitHub CLI installed:
```bash
gh repo create molder91/BasisHax --public --source=. --push
```

### Manual Upload
If all else fails, you can manually upload the files through GitHub's web interface.
