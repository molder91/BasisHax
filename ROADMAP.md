# BasisHax Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
BasisHax is a utility software for Mac and Windows that helps users quickly switch contexts with customizable hotkeys. The primary use case is to help students and workers quickly hide their current activities when needed.

## Core Features
1. **WiFi Toggle Hotkey** - Enable/disable WiFi with a customizable hotkey
2. **Application Hiding Hotkey** - Hide current application with a customizable hotkey
3. **Context Switch Hotkey** - Combine WiFi toggle and application switch with a customizable hotkey

## UI/UX Design Principles
- Modern, minimalistic, and clean interface
- Intuitive hotkey configuration
- Cross-platform consistency (Mac and Windows)

## Development Phases
